RUNNING

To run this software after compilation:
 * Copy the contents of this directory into /apps/liightsout/ on your SD card.
    * Note that this location is hard-coded into the program, so you MUST use this exact location. Sorry.
 * Launch the game, "Liights Out!", using the Homebrew Channel.
 
(The 'source' and 'build' directories do not need to be copied to the SD card.)

You should have a directory hierarchy on your SD card similar to this:

/apps/
/apps/liightsout/
/apps/liightsout/data/
/apps/liightsout/gfx/
/apps/liightsout/source/
